This script is for creating a system that uses two versions
of sendmail. One is a RX that runs as just a user, the other
is the TX that runs as root. I didn't write that part of this
script. I simply re-packaged all of this so someone else can
get up and running quickly. It's tested code, should work:

CENTOS 8
Fedora 31

It won't work on fedora 30, the amavis packages are named differently.

Do you use let's encrypt? Change that part in the script to point
to your files. Make sure you check the maillog files for errors
when all of this is running. Don't know about let's encrypt? It's
at web site - https://letsencrypt.org. You too can get a certificate
for your machine, FREE! Please support them. Like beer, you should
help pay for it. It'll support https, sendmail, possibly other keys
that may be useful to you and use a trusted certificate.



Script will use the machine's name. Make sure it's defined to what it's
supposed to be. Set up your DNS correctly. That is, make sure you have
MX record(s). I try to make this all automatic.



Changes files in:
/etc/mail
/root
root's crontab

Installs amavis, spamassassin, sendmail, sendmail-cf, just check the script.

When the machine is booted it'll run the /root/mail.bash script. That fires up
the sendmail daemons. Don't run the sendmail startup stuff. If you have sendmail
already running make sure you back up /etc. disable sendmail.

I populate a whole bunch of /etc/mail/access entries. It'll probably overwrite your
file if you have stuff in there. This is not comprehensive, just my suggestions on
domains that tend to send out crap. If you like crap just remove those deny
entries.

Enjoy!

Constructive criticism, advice, enhacements welcome.

Make sure you see the top line, even if it says FAIL. It was encrypted to your host.
